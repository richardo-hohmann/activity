master (Release Candidate for v0.2.0)

* Begin FederateAPI unofficial implementation report.
* Use 'OrderedCollection' as the default type for 'likes', 'liked',
      'following', and 'followers' properties if the actor or object does not
      have an IRI, 'Collection', or 'OrderedCollection' set for these
      properties.
* Examine the IRI of 'objects' when applying the Origin Check policy for Update
      and Delete activities.
* If a federated Activity was already received, do not execute its side effects
      a second time.
* Add 'Like' activities to the 'likes' collection, instead of adding the
      actors. This was a specification-violating behavior.
* No longer try to fetch IRIs when deduping by IRI.
* Remove unused methods from fed_test.go.
* Fix Media Type header detection for ActivityPub messages.
* Improve code generation to remove 230,000 lines of code from the vocab
      package.
* Add list of contributors to CONTRIBUTING.md.
* README examples are tagged with golang syntax highlighting.

v0.1.1 2018-06-13

* Begin SocialAPI unofficial implementation report.
* Improved HTTP header detection for ActivityPub requests.
* Activities added to outboxes are now Set (in addition to the outbox itself).
* Fixed panic where the 'bcc' and 'bto' properties were improperly guarded.
* Fixed authn/authz shadowing when serving ActivityStream objects, causing only
      HTTP Signatures to be enforced.
* Under certain circumstances, IRIs will be fetched when an Add Activity is
      received. This behavior is a stepping stone towards a comprehensive
      solution in a future patch.
* SocialAPI Undo Activity has actors enforced the same way as the FederatedAPI.
* IRI normalization: Objects, Activities, and Links will no longer be duplicated
      when added to Collection types. Instead, IRIs are added.
* Serving ActivityStream objects will now remove the 'bcc' and 'bto' properties.
* Serving a Tombstone ActivityStream response now uses the HTTP 410 Gone status
      code.
* The 'vocab' and 'streams' subpackages now generate code to multiple files
      instead of a single large one.
* The 'deliverer' subpackage now has test coverage.
