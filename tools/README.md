# tools

Contains the code-generation logic for aspects of this library:

* `go-fed/activity/tools/defs` contains common utilities and definitions for the
  Vocabulary.
* `go-fed/activity/tools/vocab` is the tool used to generate the Vocabulary
  code.
* `go-fed/activity/tools/vocab/gen` is the library that does the heavy lifting
  of generating the Vocabulary code.
* `go-fed/activity/tools/stream` is the tool used to generate the ActivityStream
  convenience code.
* `go-fed/activity/toolsstream/gen` is the library that does the heavy lifting
  of generating the ActivityStream convenience code.

Before you continue further; a fair warning. This code is in severe need of
tender love and care.
